# Assignment 1

I found a WebGL example that seems intriguing and is listed on GitHub as well. This application mimics the
movement of fluid in response to the user's movement of their mouse with adherence to direction and speed.
This example itself is intriguing as it reminded me of a flash game I used to play years ago as a kid
called 'The Powder Game' which has a similar set of fluid response embedded into it, however with more
factors dictating causation of movement.
