For my final project I want to create an animated background/wallpaper that could be used on my own website.
This could involve basing the scene off of an existing image and creating animation that would provide a moving visual effect to the viewer,
possibly through mesh use or something similar.  

Schedule for completion:  
Week 1:  
Find image, choose what animation/movement to implement on scene  
Week 2:  
Implement primary code for scene and importing image, start on animation  
Week 3:  
Implement animation and finalize any other code necessary  
Week 4:  
Work on and finish presentation for project
